            <h1 class="post-title">The First Human in Space</h1>
            <p>
                Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union was the first human in space, 
                with his flight taking off on the 12th of April 1961. 
                He piloted the Vostok 1,
                which circled the Earth at an incredible speed of 27,400 kilometers per hour. 
                He orbited Earth once in 1 hour and 29 minutes,
                at a maximum altitude of 301 kilometers. 
                He was awarded the Order of Lenin and given the titles Hero of the Soviet Union,
                as well as Pilot Cosmonaut of the Soviet Union.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gagarin experienced true weightlessness for the first time in space, and carried out 
                multiple experiments, beginning with eating and drinking to demonstrate the effects of zero gravity and human digestion.
                They were also unsure of how humans would act in zero gravity, so most of the ship was automated, but these precautions turned out to be redundant.

                After completing one orbit around the Earth, Gagarin ejected from the capsule at an
                altitude of about 7 kilometers and parachuted safely to the ground.
                Gagarin's space exploration had profound implications for space exploration, and even showcased the Soviet Union's 
                technological prowess. 

                After all of this, his flight paved the way space exploration and remains a crucial event in humanity's history.

            <h2 class="post-title">Landing on the Moon</h2>
            <p>
                The Apollo 11 mission is one of mankind's most significant achievements. The flight crew, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,
                Michael Collins launched from Kennedy Space Center aboard a Saturn V rocket, which was the most powerful rocket ever built at the time.
                The crew traveled approximately 384,400 kilometers over three days, until they eventually ended up in lunar orbit.
                Only Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon, using the Lunar Module aboard the Saturn V. They launched on July 16th, 1969 and returned to Earth on July 24th, 1969.
                Despite the few days of the crew being in space, many important scientific experiments were carried out.
            </p>
            <p>
                They sampled 21.5 kilograms of lunar rock and soil to bring to Earth and analyse. They had a seismometer to measure moonquakes,
                and they also had a laser reflector to accurately measure the distance of the Moon from the Earth.
                Communication was also tested between planets, as a phone call was made to US President Richard Nixon.

                The Moon Landing was incredibly important for the US in the space race against Russia, and provided invaluable data, advancing our understanding of the Solar System.

                The Saturn V had less processing power than a current smartphone, yet it successfully navigated the spacecraft to the Moon.
                Neil Armstrong's footprint still remains on the moon, preserved in the vacuum of space, as there is no wind or erosion to get rid of it.

            <h3 class="post-title">The Opportunity Mars Rover</h3>
            <p>
                The Opportunity Mars Rover is a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 to 2018.
                The rover was operational on Mars for over 14 years, gathering data about the planet since it had landed there.
                There was another rover that was operational at the same time, but unfortunately the rover did not last as long as the Opportunity rover.
                The rover stayed operational using solar energy, and hibernating during dust storms and other events. This operation saved power and conserved the rover to operate multiple times, its initial predicted lifespan.
                The rover last contacted NASA on June 10th 2018, and at that point the rover had traveled a distance of 45.16 kilometers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Highlights from the mission include. finding meteorites such as the Heat Shield Rock, and exploring the Victoria crater for over two years.
                In December 2014, NASA reported that Opportunity was suffering from 'amnesia' events in which the rover failed to write data to non-volatile memory. The hardware failure was believed to be erosion over it's lifespan.
                The rover had survived moderate dust storms but ceased communication after a larger dust storm took place. It was assumed that the rover's solar panels were covered in dust and could not absorb sunlight anymore.
