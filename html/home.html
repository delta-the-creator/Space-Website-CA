            Human-space activities began in 1957, with the launch of first satellite.
            Since then, humanity has expanded the reach of their activities to the Moon, Mars and other celestial bodies.
            Satellites have been made for communication, weather forecasts, and for a lot more functions.
            The aim of venturing into space is to explore the universe and it's phenomena.
            We aim to expand our understanding of the universe, and it also allows us to develop a new viewpoint of our own planet.
            For example, the International Space Station (ISS) allows us to study various parts of the earth, and monitor the temperature of certain parts of the earth.
            This allows us to examine climate change and the effects of human activities on the environment.
            The ISS allows us to target areas that may be at risk of heating up, causing fires in the area, and prevent such disasters from happening.
