            Human-space activities began in 1957, with the launch of first satellite.
            Since then, humanity has expanded the reach of their activities to the Moon, Mars and other celestial bodies.
            Satellites have been made for communication, weather forecasts, and for a lot more functions.
            The aim of venturing into space is to explore the universe and it's phenomena.
            We aim to expand our understanding of the universe, and it also allows us to develop a new viewpoint of our own planet.
            For example, the International Space Station (ISS) allows us to study various parts of the earth, and monitor the temperature of certain parts of the earth.
            This allows us to examine climate change and the effects of human activities on the environment.
            The ISS allows us to target areas that may be at risk of heating up, causing fires in the area, and prevent such disasters from happening.

        <h2>Why is space even important?</h2>
        <p>
            Space Exploration is important for humanity as it explains the fundamental questions about the origins of the universe, and the potential for life beyond Earth.
            Studying Earth is important as it provides critical data on climate change, weather patterns, and natural disasters.
            Missions to other planets allow us gather information on potentially different elements, or more resources on a planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exploring space is also important for pushing the boundaries of technology and then implementing those machines into practical solutions on Earth.
            An example of this is the ever increasing use of water purification systems. The purification systems can be used back on Earth to provide more clean water solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Space also gives us the opportunity boost the economy. There are many jobs being created due to the space industry, in fields including engineering, manufacturing, and research.
            The development of the space industry paves the way for new markets to open up. For example, there will be markets for commercial ventures, such as satelite services, or even space tourism.
            These large space projects allow for us to collaborate with other countries, and work together to achieve a common goal.
